# 3D Grayscale Volumetric Image Slicing
This is a project for BIOEN 217 "Matlab Fundamentals For Bioengineers" at the University of Washington.
## File Organization
- `obliqueslice2d.m` is a function file that implements oblique slicing through 2D grayscale image. 
- `obliqueslice3d.m` is a function file that implements oblique slicing through 2D grayscale volumetric image. 
- `Teng_Jui_Lin_Final_Project` gives one demonstration for each function. 
- `demo_images.m` stores the code for drawing images that appeared on the presentation.
- doc
  - `Teng-Jui Lin - BIOEN 217 Final Presentation.pdf` gives high level visual overview of the project.
  - `Teng-Jui Lin - BIOEN 217 Final Report.pdf` gives implementation details of the project.
